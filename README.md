# Ctrl

Ctrl is a small node app that I made for study, using it in a combo with [Ex](https://github.com/caiodomingues/ex) client.

## Use Case

I have an old notebook with a broken screen and I barely use my TV, so I plugged the notebook in the TV and control the PC to do some basic tasks with this.

Now im listening to music or watching videos in my TV :D

### But why not doing Remote Access

Because creating things is funnier :D

## How to use

It's pretty simple, in `./config` there's a `startup.bat` file, copy this in the startup folder of your pc, you can find the folder on a Windows by hitting `ctrl+r` and `shell:startup`.

As i've said, i'm using it with Ex client so any person in my house have an account and specific controls.

Please make sure to change the path in `startup.bat`

## Commands

They're divided into two steps:

`command:parameter`

- `chrome:url`
- `youtube:video-url` = or video id
- `self:os-commands` = shutdown, reboot, abort

## Notice

I haven't made this with the idea of making a repo, but, why not? So, bugs may happen, code may be bad and etc.
